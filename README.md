### Code Quality

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality automatically. Run `make setup` to install all dependencies and hooks.

**Ruff** handles all code formatting, linting, import sorting, and security checks in a single fast tool, replacing Black, isort, flake8, and most Bandit checks.

#### Manual Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks manually
make pre-commit

# Run individual tools (if needed)
ruff check .                    # Linting and security checks
ruff format .                   # Code formatting
mypy plain_mcp_server/         # Type checking
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks Include:
- **Ruff**: Code formatting, linting, import sorting, and security checks
- **MyPy**: Type checking (main package only)
- **Standard hooks**: Trailing whitespace, file endings, YAML/JSON validation

Hooks run automatically on every `git commit`, ensuring consistent code quality.
